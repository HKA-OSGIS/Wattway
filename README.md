WattWay: EV Route Planning and Charging Station Optimization
WattWay is an open-source project designed to help Electric Vehicle (EV) owners plan the most efficient routes and find optimal charging stations based on their current location, battery levels, and route preferences. This system integrates advanced algorithms to calculate the best routes that minimize travel time and energy consumption while ensuring that users have access to charging stations along the way.

<h4>Project Overview </h4> <br>
The WattWay project aims to make long-distance travel in electric vehicles more feasible and efficient. By considering variables such as battery capacity, energy consumption, route distance, and charging station availability, WattWay provides the best route options, including stops for charging, to ensure that drivers can reach their destination without running out of power. <br>

Core Features <br>
Route Planning: Calculate the most efficient route from the user's starting point to the destination. <br>
Charging Station Mapping: Locate charging stations along the route, considering the vehicle's current battery level and range. <br>
Charging Station Recommendations: Suggest optimal charging stations based on user preferences, such as charging speed, availability, and distance. <br>
Real-time Updates: Get updated information on charging station availability (e.g., occupied or free). <br>
Energy Consumption Estimation: Estimate the energy usage for a trip, factoring in terrain, speed limits, and vehicle specifics. <br>
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use web or mobile interface to visualize the route and charging stations.
